# CodeAlpha_Hangman-Game
The code in the repository "CodeAlpha_Hangman-Game" implements a classic Hangman game using Python, provided in Jupyter Notebook format. Hereâ€™s a summary of its functionality:

The game chooses a random word from a predefined list (e.g., "python", "hangman", "program", "computer", "keyboard").
The player is greeted and instructed to guess the word to "save the man."
The length of the chosen word is displayed, and the game uses a series of ASCII art drawings to visually represent the hangman's state after each incorrect guess.
The player guesses one letter at a time. Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word, while incorrect guesses add to the hangman drawing.
The game tracks the letters the player has already guessed and the current state of the word.
The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly (wins) or reaches the maximum number of wrong guesses (loses).
There are two main notebook files in the repo, both providing slight variations of the Hangman game logic, but the primary structure and gameplay are the same.

The code is beginner-friendly and demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input handling, list management, and printing formatted output using ASCII art.
