This project gave me the chance to strengthen my logic-building and problem-solving skills while applying Python fundamentals. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the game works:

ðŸ”¹ Word Selection â€“ The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
ðŸ”¹ User Input â€“ Players guess one letter at a time.
ðŸ”¹ Game Logic â€“

If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct position(s).

If the guess is wrong, the player loses one chance.
ðŸ”¹ Winning Condition â€“ The player wins if they guess the complete word before running out of chances.
ðŸ”¹ Losing Condition â€“ If the player uses all attempts, the game ends and reveals the correct word.

ðŸ’» Concepts used:

Loops (while, for)

Conditional statements (if-else)

String manipulation

Lists & sets

Random module in Python

This hands-on exercise helped me understand how to combine different Python concepts to build an interactive project. ðŸŽ¯

Iâ€™m really grateful to Code Alpha for providing such practical tasks that make learning both fun and impactful!
